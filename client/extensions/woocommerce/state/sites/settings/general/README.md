General Settings
================

This module is used to manage general settings for a site.

## Actions

### `fetchSettingsGeneral( siteId: number )`

Pull general settings from the remote site. Does not run if the settings are loading or already loaded.

## Reducer

This is saved on a per-site basis as a list of settings as returned from the site's API.

```js
{
	"settings": {
		"general": [ {
			"id": "woocommerce_allowed_countries",
			"label": "Selling location(s)",
			"description": "This option lets you limit which countries you are willing to sell to.",
			"type": "select",
			"default": "all",
			"options": {
				"all": "Sell to all countries",
				"all_except": "Sell to all countries, except for&hellip;",
				"specific": "Sell to specific countries"
			},
			"tip": "This option lets you limit which countries you are willing to sell to.",
			"value": "all",
		}, { â€¦ } ],
	},
}
```

## Selectors

### `areSettingsGeneralLoaded( state, [siteId] )`

Whether the general settings list has been successfully loaded from the server. Optional `siteId`, will default to currently selected site.

### `getPaymentCurrencySettings( state, siteId: number )`

Gets payment currency from API data.
